  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    This landing page was created to showcase my ability to use html, css and Flex Box.
    Toward the end of 2018 I made the desicion to take some coding courses because I wanted to
    learn a new skill. After a bootcamp prep course at Full Stack Academy, I knew that
    I not only was excited to learn everything about coding but I was ready to make a career change.
    Feel free to click on any of the links below to view some of the projects I worked on.
